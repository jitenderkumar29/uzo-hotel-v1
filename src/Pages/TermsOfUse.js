                the original pack are carried forward except when renewing to
                "ePrime" plan . Contact Views are the facility wherein members
                can see contact details of other members who have not
                filtered/rejected/ignored them. If a member renews his

                previous membership are not carried forward. These conditions

                special "Renewal/Repurchase/Loyalty" offer. Purchase before or
                after renewal date is the only criteria which determines if
                unused "Contact Views" are carried forward or not.

                indexed by Google/Ask/Bing/Yahoo and other search engines. If a
                search engine user types a query then your profile page may be

                Company at any time without giving any notice. Similarly If your
                phone number is not verified then even as a person who has
                availed a "Paid Service" you will still not be able to view

                verification prompts across the Platform which guide you on how
                to verify your phone. If the same is not clear then it is the
                member's responsibility to call customer care of Platform from
                the number which he/she wishes to verify.

                any message which means the same. In these cases the member just

                quota of "View Contacts".
